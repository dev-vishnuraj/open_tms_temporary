# Open-Source General-Purpose Ticket Management System

This repository aims to create an open-source general-purpose ticket management system using the [Appblocks toolkit](https://docs.appblocks.com/docs). We envision a suite of interoperable business tools that are essential and accessible as open source. Appblocks acts as the foundation, providing standardized components upon which we can build various applications. All applications will communicate with a common database layer ([SDM](https://store.appblocks.com/sdm/)) behind the scenes, and they can be easily packaged together.

In celebration of Hacktoberfest, we are initiating this project, with 'open_tms' being the first project we develop. We will start by completing the backend of the application and then proceed to build the frontend by adding issues accordingly.

Please refer to the `contribution.md` file in the root directory to set up the development environment. Feel free to reach out to the core developers through the issues' comment section.
